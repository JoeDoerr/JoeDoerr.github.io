        <p>I am interested in creating intelligent robots that can perform well in real world scenarios. To this end, my focus is on improving locomotion, navigation, and manipulation capabilities for intelligent robots within environments characterized by stochasticity, noise, and high complexity. RL is especially captivating due to not only the potential it has to autonomously find solutions in these environments, but the controllability over the solutions. I am specifically interested in the manipulation of RL design to find behaviors that are robust to observational noise or environmental stochasticity.

Additionally, I am interested in exploring the synergy between DL and RL, particularly in terms of generalization across varying task attributes, cardinally different tasks, and simulation to real life. Moreover, I am interested in targeted information capture within DL models both facilitated by RL and to facilitate RL. In the interplay between RL and robotic manipulation and locomotion, I am interested in finding solutions that not only use RL, but also properly leverage classical robotic control methods.</p>
